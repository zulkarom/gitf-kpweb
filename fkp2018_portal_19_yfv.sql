However, many construction organizations and players in the construction industry have now recognized the strategic importance of innovation. That is why the aim of this study is to evaluate innovative quality management practices in some of the Malaysian construction firms. The research was carried out as a case study based on six quality management practices: design, planning, systems, goal, positioning, and interaction practices. The data was collected through interviews and various relevant firms? documents. The analysis of this study was based on an analytical framework that consists of six quality management practices.

In contrast to previous works in the field of small businesses, this paper aims to provide empirical evidence that entrepreneurial competencies mediate the relationship between microfinance and small business growth. The paper formulates three hypotheses from previous literature review. These hypotheses are tested using the Structural Equation Modeling with data collected from 243 microfinance participants. The findings indicate that microfinance has a strong association with small business growth. However, the results provide evidence that entrepreneurial competencies play a partial mediating role between microfinance and small business growth. The small sample size, which was dominated by small businesses, was the major limitation of the study. The sample size and distribution also inhibited the comparison of the results between industry sectors. This result can be used in the study on the impact of microfinance toward small business growth in the future. By testing the interaction effect of microfinance and entrepreneurial competencies in small business growth, this paper advances previous works on this area, by looking at the relationship between microfinance and entrepreneurial competencies on small business growth simultaneously.

Using 78 CEO turnover firms from 2008 to 2010 among nonfinancial institution, we find that the age of the CEO influences restatement in the year prior to the CEO turnover. Specifically, older CEOs have higher probability of restating financial statements as they may be pressing for the last bonus/pay that they would likely receive. In contrast, we find that CEOs with forced turnover are less likely to be involved with restatements. This contradicting result may be due to the limited control of financial and accounting matters by the outgoing CEO as compared to the board of directors. Firm characteristics such as size, Big 4, and growth as measured by the market to book value have a positive relationship with restatement, which suggests that big companies with high growth have higher probability of restatement. The study also supports the argument of debt as a monitoring cost as debt is argued to constraint opportunistic earnings management behavior including restatement. ', 'Barro, J.R., and Barro, R.J.

Literature reviewed indicated that social, culture, family or group influences might outweigh the intrinsic trigger factors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to apply the proposed model by previous researchers in the Malaysian family setting. The model proposed the relationship between personal norms with satisfaction, social norms and preference conflict in making family food selection. This study was done in Klang Valley using the convenience sampling method and data were gathered using a questionnaire survey form. Survey respondents were Malaysians of at least 18 years of age, married with children and those who were responsible for preparing the meal for family members. 190 respondents participated in this study. The result showed that there is a significant mediating role by satisfaction and social norms, between personal norm and family food selection, while preference conflict is not a significant mediator. Mediation analysis and regression analysis was done to determine the most influential factors in family food selection and found the mediating role of social norms as the strongest compared to satisfaction. In conclusion, the model of personal norms, satisfaction, social norms, and preference conflict proposed by previous researchers, which was done in Western countries, had different results when applied to the Malaysian family setting. This could be due to the culture of more consensuses rather than individualism practiced by most Malaysian families compared to western families as far as family food selection is concerned.

Inspired by space and boundary theories, this study explored the concepts of entrepreneurship through small high technology ventures and the meaning given to space and boundaries by the leaders and followers as an inter-subjective phenomenon. By examining the ways the leaders and followers interact and the different forms of conversations and discourses that are being used by the leaders and followers, it is expected that the reality behind entrepreneurship, and the social space and boundaries could be uncovered. This study utilised a qualitative approach that adopts a phenomenological symbolic interactionism theoretical background. Specifically, this study employs a narrative inquiry method to capture the language and meaning in order to understand how social space and boundaries are constructed in small high technology firms. This study found that the social space of small high technology firms are constructed through trust, support, respect, recognition, and a democratic power relation. The findings indicate that the social boundaries of small high technology firms have a sense of companionship.

The empirical results show that human capital inequality has a significant positive effect on income inequality. This result is similar to the theoretical framework, where human capital and income inequality are positively correlated. However, other control variables such as Global and total population are insignificant with income inequality except for GDP per capita at 5 and 10 percent levels. Thus, in order to reduce income inequality and to give citizens equal opportunities, governments of developed and developing countries and policymakers need to minimize human capital inequality.

Two dependent variables were used as a proxy for dividend namely the dividend per share (DPS) and dividend payout ratio (DPR), while 8 government agencies (EPF, LTH, KWAP, LTAT, MKD, KNB, PNB and STATE) represented government ownership. Since dividends are truncated, the Tobit model was utilized to examine the effect of government ownership. The findings showed that there is no relationship between government ownership and dividends when using the DPS as the dependent variable. However, when DPR is used, the result showed that government ownership could affect the dividend policy. Furthermore, it is found that privately funded government agencies were more likely to affect dividends. This result indicates that these government agencies influence the proportion of earnings distribution or the payable amount rather than the amount of dividend per unit of shares.

There may be problems in performing these functions by entrepreneurs, because of certain factors, which affect their involvement in entrepreneurial activities. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of socio-economic factors on entrepreneurial activities in Cape Coast, Ghana. A simple random sampling method is used to select 181 entrepreneurs from Cape Coast for the study. The Structural Equation Model-Partial Least Square version 2.0 is used for the analysis. The finding reveals that inflation, high tax rate, religion, and life style of the entrepreneurs significantly influence their entrepreneurial activities and performance. The study concludes that for a successful entrepreneurship performance to be achieved, there is a need for good socio-cultural conditions and sound economic policies to be put in place. The study recommends that the government should reduce the interest rate to make borrowing flexible to entrepreneurs and a lower tax regime should be commenced to encourage low-level income earners to have access to funding for entrepreneurship activities in Cape Coast, Ghana.

It is important for managers to adapt ideas and practices from time to time since organizations and environments are continuously improving. Since work life balance poses a heavy cost to the organization in terms of time and cost, even though the employment laws now permits family friendly programs, workplace implementation still remains a big challenge. Investing in what may work out well for the organization is also unavoidable. It has come to a time for management to embrace work family programs to permit managers to take care of their family issues. With growing technology and multiple generations co-existing with different behavioral norms, a shift from traditional approach to Work?Life balance (WLB) integration has become a big issue in managing human resource. Accordingly, we explore how advancement in information technology is shifting WLB-high performance achievement relationship. Data were collected from 265 managers. Hypotheses were tested using multiple and hierarchical regression analyses. The result did not support that WLB has a direct positive impact on performance. However, we found that WLB has an indirect influence on high performance achievement through the advancement in information technology.

This study is motivated by the lack of concern in providing the perfect amount of food and non-food items in zakat distributions as a poverty alleviation program for these groups. The difference between food and non-food expenditure that does not reflect the true expenditure among the poor and needy can make poverty alleviation (zakat distribution) ineffective. The Kelantan state was selected because of their achievement of being among the highest zakat fund collectors and distributors (fourth in Malaysia and the highest among the government zakat agencies) (MAIK, 2014). Conversely, the state of Kelantan also has among the highest number of poor and needy in Malaysia (EPU, 2014). A sample of 505 households from the 2014 Household Expenditure Survey (HES) among the poor and needy zakat recipients in Kelantan is used in this study. Descriptive statistics is used to profile the pattern of household expenditure on food and non-food items, expenditure patterns of food and non-food items across poverty status and an estimation of the effects of household characteristics on food and non-food expenditures. Household characteristics include age, region (rural/urban), gender, size, and household head?s marital status. The findings show that the expenditure pattern among the poor and needy is different based on food and non-food items? shares. The result of this study indicates that not all poor and needy in Kelantan spend most of their expenditure on food items. Thus, applying the same higher food items on each poor and needy household would overstate the food expenditure and devalue the cost of non-food items. Therefore, it will create a flawed poverty line which will further create a flawed poverty assessment.

In contrast to previous works in the field of small businesses, this paper aims to provide empirical evidence that entrepreneurial competencies mediate the relationship between microfinance and small business growth. The paper formulates three hypotheses from previous literature review. These hypotheses are tested using the Structural Equation Modeling with data collected from 243 microfinance participants. The findings indicate that microfinance has a strong association with small business growth. However, the results provide evidence that entrepreneurial competencies play a partial mediating role between microfinance and small business growth. The small sample size, which was dominated by small businesses, was the major limitation of the study. The sample size and distribution also inhibited the comparison of the results between industry sectors. This result can be used in the study on the impact of microfinance toward small business growth in the future. By testing the interaction effect of microfinance and entrepreneurial competencies in small business growth, this paper advances previous works on this area, by looking at the relationship between microfinance and entrepreneurial competencies on small business growth simultaneously.

Using 78 CEO turnover firms from 2008 to 2010 among nonfinancial institution, we find that the age of the CEO influences restatement in the year prior to the CEO turnover. Specifically, older CEOs have higher probability of restating financial statements as they may be pressing for the last bonus/pay that they would likely receive. In contrast, we find that CEOs with forced turnover are less likely to be involved with restatements. This contradicting result may be due to the limited control of financial and accounting matters by the outgoing CEO as compared to the board of directors. Firm characteristics such as size, Big 4, and growth as measured by the market to book value have a positive relationship with restatement, which suggests that big companies with high growth have higher probability of restatement. The study also supports the argument of debt as a monitoring cost as debt is argued to constraint opportunistic earnings management behavior including restatement.

Literature reviewed indicated that social, culture, family or group influences might outweigh the intrinsic trigger factors. Therefore, the objective of this study is to apply the proposed model by previous researchers in the Malaysian family setting. The model proposed the relationship between personal norms with satisfaction, social norms and preference conflict in making family food selection. This study was done in Klang Valley using the convenience sampling method and data were gathered using a questionnaire survey form. Survey respondents were Malaysians of at least 18 years of age, married with children and those who were responsible for preparing the meal for family members. 190 respondents participated in this study. The result showed that there is a significant mediating role by satisfaction and social norms, between personal norm and family food selection, while preference conflict is not a significant mediator. Mediation analysis and regression analysis was done to determine the most influential factors in family food selection and found the mediating role of social norms as the strongest compared to satisfaction. In conclusion, the model of personal norms, satisfaction, social norms, and preference conflict proposed by previous researchers, which was done in Western countries, had different results when applied to the Malaysian family setting. This could be due to the culture of more consensuses rather than individualism practiced by most Malaysian families compared to western families as far as family food selection is concerned.

Since dividends are truncated, the Tobit model was utilized to examine the effect of government ownership. The findings showed that there is no relationship between government ownership and dividends when using the DPS as the dependent variable. However, when DPR is used, the result showed that government ownership could affect the dividend policy. Furthermore, it is found that privately funded government agencies were more likely to affect dividends.

The study found that the internal and external sources of finance were insignificantly related to the SMEs? performance, while business experience, level of education, and firm size were positively related to the SMEs\' performance. The findings of this study reveal that finance is not the main source that needs to be taken into account by entrepreneurs, supporting institutions, and policy makers in improving the SMEs? performance. Further research in this area of study should extend into examining and adding more components that are relevant to a variation of the SMEs? performance.

Despite these advantages, cloud computing adoption among organizations is relatively slow with a low adoption rate. As such, this study attempts to bridge the gap by offering insight into possible factors that could influence such adoption decisions. By integrating the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (DOI) and IT personnel characteristics, a conceptual model is developed and tested as a preliminary study to determine the influencing factors of cloud computing adoption by the Malaysian public sector to enhance its service delivery. The results revealed that relative advantage, compatibility, and IT personnel knowledge are the innovation attributes and the human factor for cloud computing adoption in the Malaysian public sector.

In addition, the Private Label (PL) component is a crucial element of the export transaction. Similarly, despite the fact that PDO is the main vehicle for economic growth, firms suffer from a \'retrogressive nature\' in terms of export development, as the State?s institutional intervention discourages internationalisation.

Realizing the importance of entrepreneurship that spurs economic growth, the government of Malaysia encourages future entrepreneurs to participate in entrepreneurship training programs to ensure they increase entrepreneurship capabilities and achieve sustainability in their ventures. In order to do so, training programs should cater to the important requirements of effective training in order to deliver the expected objectives. Thus, this paper aims to explore the determinants of the effectiveness of an entrepreneurship- training program using UMK?s students as the sample. Entrepreneurship students? perception on this is vital as they might be the entrepreneurs who will be involved in an entrepreneurship training program once they graduate from the university. This study adopted the purposive sampling method, where 50 students from the Faculty of Entrepreneurship and Business were selected to answer the structured questionnaires. The results of the study revealed that the trainees? readiness and learning approach were determinants of the effectiveness of the training program.

To analyze and interpret the result, a measurement model and a structural model were utilized for the main constructs ? managing market complexity, skills, perceived usefulness, and the usage of marketing support services. This study found that owners, who are facing difficulties in managing their businesses, which are focused on market complexity, are more frequent users of the marketing support services. In terms of skills, SMEs with longer experience are lesser users of the marketing support services. The results from the moderator analysis failed to validate that perceived usefulness affects the relationship between managing market complexity and the frequency of usage as well as skills. The results of this study can prove to SMEs that frequent use of marketing support services can help in dealing with market complexity. The role of perceived usefulness should not be sidelined by service providers as it may have a negative impact in the long run.

Some of the studies have focused on distinguishing between male and female entrepreneurs in terms of their personal skills and socio-demographic characteristics and others have attempted to determine individual intention and behavior toward entrepreneurship. The study analyzes gender difference on the perception of motivational factors and barriers for business start- up among graduates. The study is conducted in Kano metropolitan using a cross sectional/survey design. The population of the study composes of graduates who are either unemployed or employed for not more than three years and have obtained a Bachelor degree or Higher National Diploma qualification as the basis for selection. Discriminant analysis (DA) is used to investigate gender difference on the basis of perception about the selected variables on business start-up. Discriminant analysis is useful in creating an equation that will minimize the possibility of misclassifying cases in their respective groups or categories. The result shows highly significant discriminant function (p < .000) and indicates that the proportion of the total variability not explained is about 37.7%. The Box?s M is 14.012 with F = 4.638, which is highly significant at p < 0.003. There is evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which states that the groups do not differ on their perception about motivation and barriers for business start-up. It is recommended for future studies to explore the moderating effect of religiosity and culture on business start-up.

A simple random sampling method is used to select 181 entrepreneurs from Cape Coast for the study. The Structural Equation Model-Partial Least Square version 2.0 is used for the analysis. The finding reveals that inflation, high tax rate, religion, and life style of the entrepreneurs significantly influence their entrepreneurial activities and performance. The study concludes that for a successful entrepreneurship performance to be achieved, there is a need for good socio-cultural conditions and sound economic policies to be put in place.

By utilizing time series data from 1976 to 2016, a series of empirical analysis including the Augmented-Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillip Peron (1988) unit root assessment, Johansen and Juselius test of cointegration and Granger causality analysis are employed to assess the direction of impact and long-run relationships between the variables.

It is important for managers to adapt ideas and practices from time to time since organizations and environments are continuously improving. Since work life balance poses a heavy cost to the organization in terms of time and cost, even though the employment laws now permits family friendly programs, workplace implementation still remains a big challenge. Investing in what may work out well for the organization is also unavoidable. It has come to a time for management to embrace work family programs to permit managers to take care of their family issues. With growing technology and multiple generations co-existing with different behavioral norms, a shift from traditional approach to Work?Life balance (WLB) integration has become a big issue in managing human resource. Accordingly, we explore how advancement in information technology is shifting WLB-high performance achievement relationship. Data were collected from 265 managers. Hypotheses were tested using multiple and hierarchical regression analyses. The result did not support that WLB has a direct positive impact on performance. However, we found that WLB has an indirect influence on high performance achievement through the advancement in information technology. The study demonstrated that advancement in information technology influences how managers manage both work and life domains.

', 'This article attempts to analyze the food and non-food expenditure among the poor and needy zakat recipients in Kelantan, Malaysia, which holds the lowest quartile of poor population. This study is motivated by the lack of concern in providing the perfect amount of food and non-food items in zakat distributions as a poverty alleviation program for these groups. The difference between food and non-food expenditure that does not reflect the true expenditure among the poor and needy can make poverty alleviation (zakat distribution) ineffective. The Kelantan state was selected because of their achievement of being among the highest zakat fund collectors and distributors (fourth in Malaysia and the highest among the government zakat agencies) (MAIK, 2014). Conversely, the state of Kelantan also has among the highest number of poor and needy in Malaysia (EPU, 2014). A sample of 505 households from the 2014 Household Expenditure Survey (HES) among the poor and needy zakat recipients in Kelantan is used in this study. Descriptive statistics is used to profile the pattern of household expenditure on food and non-food items, expenditure patterns of food and non-food items across poverty status and an estimation of the effects of household characteristics on food and non-food expenditures. Household characteristics include age, region (rural/urban), gender, size, and household head?s marital status. The findings show that the expenditure pattern among the poor and needy is different based on food and non-food items? shares. The result of this study indicates that not all poor and needy in Kelantan spend most of their expenditure on food items. Thus, applying the same higher food items on each poor and needy household would overstate the food expenditure and devalue the cost of non-food items. Therefore, it will create a flawed poverty line which will further create a flawed poverty assessment.

Besides that, this study intended to propose a standard generic structure in writing a business email. The emails were gathered from the respondents\' assignment that comprised of two email-based questions; however, this study analysed the generic structure of sales reply emails. The emails were compared with Bhatia\'s promotional sales letter moves. The methodology of this study was computer-assisted corpus analysis (CACA) by Manvender (2011). The data were analysed using a genre-based technique by Bhatia (1993). The particular moves and steps in both types of texts were recognised and categorised individually. The rhetorical structure of sales reply emails consists of three major moves: introducing product, product details, offering incentives. Although the respondents showed similarities in their moves, there were some differences such as the number and content of the moves as well as the contextual patterns.', '<p>Askehave, I., &amp; Swales, J.

Past studies revealed that affective commitment, organisational commitment, psychological capital, job satisfaction, work environment and problematic customer behaviours were some of the contributing factors of turnover. However, authentic leadership and the role of work engagement as mediators lacked investigation for the service industry in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of four dimensions in authentic leadership on employees\' turnover intention in Malaysia call centres with work engagement as the mediating role. A total of 389 online surveys were distributed to employees working in call centres in Klang Valley and Cyberjaya. This study obtained 240 valid samples with a return rate of 60%. The results indicated that self-awareness and balanced processing of information had a significant relationship with work engagement. Work engagement was significantly related to turnover intention. Work engagement contributed as a mediator to some variables towards employees\' turnover intention. Hence, leaders are encouraged to manage tasks and relational roles. Different leadership styles have their strengths and limitations which could impact the employees\' engagement to the company.', '<p>Abbasi, S. M., &amp; Hollman, K. W. (2000).

The augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) were employed to analyse the stationary of data collected and determine the long-run relationship in the research model. The monthly data from January 2008 to September 2015 were collected from Datastream. The results revealed that there was a significant relationship for the long-run relationship between Islamic stock market and macroeconomic variables namely inflation and interest rate. The findings concluded that macroeconomic variables had a greater effect and they were inversely related to Islamic stock market. These findings may suggest policies that are controlled by macroeconomic variables such as inflation and interest rate in enhancing the Islamic stock market in Malaysia.', '<p>Adom, P.

It was believed that social media had caused the decrease in education standards and poor quality graduates. This study also examined the moderating influence of attitude on social media use and academic performance. The outcome of the study could help Malaysian government to consider proper educational and social policy decisions for better governance. A survey was conducted using proportionate stratified random sampling from three universities in Peninsular Malaysia. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression. It was discovered that the use of social media as a source of information for studies had a significant effect on the youths? academic performance in Malaysia. Therefore, the government and the management at universities should ensure that social media are mostly used for academic purposes by restricting the use of social media in the universities. It was suggested that the university may block other unimportant links and encourage students to use social media for academic issues such as assignments involving online journals.

SMEs have been touted by many economies as a backbone for their growth and hence, economic development. However, many of them struggle to have access to market and appropriate technology needed for expansion. In the light of this, this study sought to investigate this issue in the context of developing country, particularly, Ghana. The research approach adopted for this study was quantitative. In addition, whereas simple random sampling technique was adopted to select 346 manufacturing SMEs from the sample frame obtained from NBSSI, PLS-SEM was employed to analyse the relationship between market orientation and innovation orientation. The study revealed that customer orientation and inter-functional coordination have a significant positive relationship with innovation orientation. However, competitor orientation did not have a significant relationship with innovation orientation. This means that manufacturing SMEs which search and satisfy the needs of customers and also share information about customers across the organisation stand tall in improving on their operational processes, products and market activities.', '<ol>\r\n<li>Abor, J., &amp; Quartey, P.

Routinely, the students are hired through short interview sessions. However, based on the complaints received, the EDC management realizes that the outcomes from the interviews have not helped them much in selecting the most appropriate candidates to fill the vacancies. This study therefore aimed at proposing an alternate procedure that combines two quantitative techniques (i.e. simple scaling method and 0-1 integer linear programing model), to enable the management to hire and assign the right positions to the candidates, with better justifications. The usage of the procedure was illustrated by identifying six best-possible students for the part-time jobs available in Semester 2, Session 2018/2019. Three 0-1 integer linear programming models, with different objective functions, were formulated and solved with the aid of LINGO Version 12. Each model derived different set of results, and therefore the management could make their final decision by adhering to the results derived from the model that is congruous with their objective. The contributions of the study and indications for future applications are discussed in the conclusion section.\r\n', '', 5, 'ArticleWorkflow/ha-correction', '2019/asrulhery@gmail.com/submission_15583537005ce29724cf78b0.52044117.docx', '2019-05-20 20:46:57', '2019-05-20 20:01:10', '2019-05-20 20:01:47', '2019-05-20 20:47:01', 91, 91, '2019/01258A/review_15583564175ce2a1c1e97483.49002535.pdf', '', '2019-05-20 22:22:41', 0, '2019-07-05 22:40:23', 91, '2019-07-28 11:18:49', '\r\nReviewer’s comments:\r\n\r\n1.

The main motive behind this study is to acknowledge the reasons of Malaysian banking in having different rate of profitability although they are sharing the same loan growth in the country. A regression analysis is built on the panel data set comprising eight commercial banks from 2011 to 2017. To this end, the empirical data are collected from DataStream and Annual Report. Among all the determinant variables, capital adequacy do not show statistically significant impacts on profitability. Regression findings reveal that credit risk, management efficiency and liquidity risk were among the most significant determinants toward the bank?s profitability. Indeed, the variables more influence the profitability of ROE compared to ROA. In view of these findings, some suggestions may be functional for bank regulatory authorities to intensify and sustain robustness and stability of the banking sector in the country. Therefore, this paper tries to close an important gap in the existing literature by improving the understanding of bank profitability in Malaysia.', '<p>Abdul-Rahman, A., Sulaiman, A.

It investigates the relationship between the Islamic interbank money market rates (IIMMR) and conventional interbank money market rates (CIMMR), targets of open market operations (OMOs) in each sector, and their relationships with the exchange rate, inflation rate and output growth. The study looks at daily and monthly trends from 2001 through to 2017 using basic regressions, followed by Granger causality, ARDL, and VAR models. Empirical evidences show that IIMMR and CIMMR are highly cointegrated in the long run. A two-way causation exists between daily and monthly Islamic and conventional interbank rates. Based on VECMs estimation, IRFs are generated to show the effects of shocks to IIMMR and CIMMR. It proves that CIMMR has strong influences on exchange rate and output growth, while IIMMR has strong influences on inflation rate. The implication of such results to policy is that a possible feedback of transmission will occur from conventional to Islamic banking system. With the IIMMR being more closely linked to inflation, this indicates the validity of IIMMR as a key monetary transmitter that can be used to replace or be used concurrently with CIMMR. Unlike the empirical evidence from previous studies, this study shows clearly that IIMMR is an efficient transmitter of monetary policy through to inflation rate in predicting economic activity in a dual banking system.', '', 4, 'ArticleWorkflow/ha-correction', '2019/asrulhery@gmail.com/submission_15590505595ced393f2629d1.49231915.docx', '2019-05-28 21:38:50', '2019-05-28 21:35:10', '2019-05-28 21:36:08', '2019-05-28 21:38:58', 91, 91, '2019/01258A/review_15590507305ced39ea31acd3.74363762.pdf', '', '2019-05-29 08:47:22', 0, '2019-06-11 21:09:30', 69, '2019-06-12 12:49:47', '\r\nME\'s Recommendation: Minor\r\n\r\nReviewer\'s Comments:\r\n\r\nterm of IRF in abstract should be in full sentences first.\r\nIntro: Each paragraph start with the EVERY (author should resentense this paragraph)\r\nObjective: Clearly state in the introduction\r\nProblem satatement/issues: Clearly discuss \r\nMethodology: ARDL and VAR- Relevent to the objectives of the study\r\nAnalysis: Done correctly for the step of ARDL and VAR, all the results discuss clearly\r\nConclusion: Good\r\nPolicy recomendation: Good and the policy can apply to the islamic and conventional bank\r\nReference: Should follow the APA style formating.\r\n\r\n1.

Therefore, these variables are used to measure the overall performance of non-government telecommunication firms within 10 years? time. This study is motivated with the declining of telecommunication firms? performance in Malaysia due to a decreasing of return on asset (ROA). The finding suggests that leverage has a significant and negative relationship with the ROA. On the other hand, size has a significant and positive relationship with ROA.

Nonetheless, only a handful of studies have determined the correlations between online store image and dimensions of perceived risks in online shopping. Therefore, this study identified the significant relationships between online store image and eight types of perceived risks.

Entrepreneurial readiness is defined as a readiness or preparedness of an individual in pursuing the business. Therefore, the aim of the study is to measure the level of entrepreneurial competence and entrepreneurial readiness among the medical students and its association with the sociodemographic factors. Methods:  A cross-sectional study was conducted among 284 medical students at private university. The data was collected by self-administered questionnaire adopted from previous studies. Results: A total of 95% of the respondents have a high level of entrepreneurial competence. For the entrepreneurial readiness, 17% of the respondents were not ready while 62% need to re-evaluate themselves before starting any entrepreneurial activity. Only 21% of the respondents are ready to start any entrepreneurial activity. The gender, age, family income and involvement in entrepreneurial projects are statistically significant to the level of Entrepreneurial Competence (p=0.01, p<0.001, p<0.001 and p= 0.01 respectively). The family background, marital status, age and involvement in entrepreneurial projects are statistically significant to the level of Entrepreneurial Readiness.

The main motive behind this study is to acknowledge the reasons of Malaysian banking in having different rate of profitability although they are sharing the same loan growth in the country. A regression analysis is built on the panel data set comprising eight commercial banks from 2011 to 2017. To this end, the empirical data are collected from DataStream and Annual Report. Among all the determinant variables, capital adequacy do not show statistically significant impacts on profitability. Regression findings reveal that credit risk, management efficiency and liquidity risk were among the most significant determinants toward the bank?s profitability. Indeed, the variables more influence the profitability of ROE compared to ROA. In view of these findings, some suggestions may be functional for bank regulatory authorities to intensify and sustain robustness and stability of the banking sector in the country.

It requires young, innovative and ICT literate individuals. Malaysian government has put in a lot of efforts to develop entrepreneurial skills among the young generation especially university students. However, there are many challenges in developing young technology-based entrepreneurs or technopreneurs. For instance, Malaysia recorded low scores in a few entrepreneurial behaviors and attitudes identified by Global Entrepreneurial Monitor (GEM). Besides, not many Malaysians have established new businesses and the early stage entrepreneurship rate is still low and even decreasing. In addition, university students are showing low interest to become entrepreneurs during their tertiary education. The future of IR 4.0 is full of changes, unpredictable and very challenging. IR 4.0 would affect Malaysia’s vision and mission to develop competitive entrepreneurs and become a developed country. Thus, studies regarding technology-based entrepreneurship development in Malaysia is indeed needed. In the entrepreneurship literature, technological capability and psychological aspects such as individual entrepreneurial orientation (IEO) and entrepreneurial intention are insufficiently researched. Therefore, this research suggested a model to explain the direct and indirect influence of ICT self-efficacy and environmental factor on technopreneurial intention through IEO. In terms of the potential contributions of this research, it created a new model for exploring technopreneurial intention. In addition, it offered insights into policy implementation in developing competitive technopreneurial graduates, creating innovative individuals in technology fields and transforming Malaysia into a knowledge economy. It also identified the varieties of ICT capabilities which might be vital in developing revolutionary and entrepreneurial human capital.

Yao dan Chen Tsang (2014) menyatakan bahawa program kulinari yang terdapat di universiti terkemuka di Taiwan seperti National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism telah mereka program kulinari dengan teliti untuk meningkatkan kebolehpasaran para graduan yang memenuhi permintaan industri hospitaliti yang persekitaran kompetitif.  \r\n	\r\n	Untuk memenuhi banyak permintaan daripada industri, program ini ternyata sangat memberi impak sehinggakan lebih sepuluh (10) Universiti Awam dan Universiti Swasta telah menawarkan program kulinari di Malaysia, dimana ia menunjukkan program ini menjadi tarikan dan pilihan orang ramai untuk menyambung pengajian. Penawaran program yang sama oleh Universiti Awam dan Swasta menyebabkan pertambahan graduan diploma kulinari, dengan penawaran program baharu ini ia memberikan peluang kepada graduan diploma kulinari untuk menyambung pengajian kepada peringkat yang lebih tinggi.\r\n	   \r\nDengan keadaan ekonomi semasa yang kurang stabil, universiti boleh menjalinkan kerjasama dengan hotel-hotel, Universiti atau Kolej-Kolej yang berkaitan untuk menyediakan kemudahan atau makmal pengajaran dan pembelajaran seperti ruang dapur dan ruang makan melalui penawaran program ini. Oleh itu, langkah kerjasama antara Universiti dan pemegang taruh dapat direalisasikan.  \r\n\r\n	Sept 2016, Jeffri Munir, Pengarah Pejabat Kementerian Pelancongan Negeri Melaka, seramai 1.3 juta tenaga kerja mahir dalam bidang kulinari diperlukan oleh seluruh negara menjelang tahun 2020. Lembaga Pembangunan Pelaburan Malaysia (2016), sebanyak 112,194 peluang pekerjaan untuk hotel dan pelancongan.Malahan, telah meningkat sebanyak 44, 269 dalam masa 6 bulan. Pasaran global turut mengalami peningkatan dalam kebolehpasaran program kulinari.Ini dibuktikan oleh   statistik yang dikeluarkan oleh US LABOR BUREAU (2015), berlaku peningkatan kira-kira 70,000 kekosongan dalam peluang pekerjaan setahun.Makanan bukan sahaja satu keperluan untuk kewujudan manusia tetapi ia merangkumi aktiviti sosial dan seni dimana makanan dibentuk menjadi seni yang paling lazat. Seni masakan yang dicipta oleh artis masakan (chef) mampu mempengaruhi emosi dari pelbagai tahap (Eriskson, 2016). Seseorang yang telah mempelajari dan mempunyai seni masakan mampu meletakkan “semangat” ke dalam masakan melalui bahan-bahan yang betul hingga mewujudkan hidangan yang sempurna. \r\n	\r\n	Selain mempunyai naluri dan rasa untuk menggabungkan pelbagai bahan-bahan masakan untuk menggembirakan deria seseorang, seseorang yang telah mempelajari dan mempunyai seni masakan juga mesti mempunyai pengetahuan yang mendalam tentang sains makanan, pemakanan dan diet.  \r\n \r\nProgram kulinari adalah amat penting untuk industri restoran (National Restaurant Association Vice President of Labor and Workforce Policy, 2010). Program-program pendidikan ini mengajar pelajar kemahiran yang diperlukan untuk membina kerjaya dalam industri restoran dan perkhidmatan makanan pada masa kini. Industri makanan dan minuman mempunyai peluang perkerjaan yang banyak pada setiap tahun. Disebabkan banyak permintaan ke atas program-program kulinari ini, yang banyak memberi impak kepada ekonomi semasa, amatlah disarankan Kementerian Pendidikan terus menyokong institusi-institusi yang menawarkan program ini yang boleh terus membina peluang kerjaya yang banyak. Terdapat beberapa faktor yang memberi justifikasi kenapa perlu menawarkan Kulinari program:\r\n\r\n	Program Kulinari adalah program yang saling- berkaitan antara satu sama lain dengan banyak industri penting yang lain.\r\n\r\n	Hari ini, bidang kulinari adalah satu bidang yang luas yang merangkumi beberapa aspek penting dalam    kehidupan: makanan, kopi, koktel, pelbagai jenis makanan dan banyak lagi. Bidang ini telah menjadi salah satu yang industri pesat berkembang dan merangkumi sebahagian besarnya indiustri-industri yang lain.\r\n\r\n	Seni masakan yang diterima di seluruh dunia. \r\n\r\n	Walaupun program kulinari banyak yang berbeza, tetapi program ini harus merangkumi banyak atau  semua yang berikut yang sama seperti program kulinari yang lain contohnya penggunaan peralatan dapur yang betul, pemakanan dan sanitasi, perancangan menu dan bahagian kawalan, prosedur penyimpanan makanan, termasuk  mengurangkan sisa makanan dan lain-lain lagi. Terdapat juga penyeliaan makanan yang betul seperti: (Program internship dengan restoran tempatan; pengalaman itu boleh menjadi cara yang baik untuk mendapat pengalaman berharga dan kenalan rangkaian profesional.\r\n	\r\n	Kepelbagaian Jenis Masakan\r\n\r\n	Terdapat kepelbagaian dalam mempelajari ilmu masakan dan jenis makanan yang boleh didapati dalam banyak bandar-bandar dunia atau Malaysia sendiri anda boleh mencari masakan dan restoran yang hebat yang terbaik dalam dunia makanan yang boleh tawarkan. Belum termasuk seni makanan tempatan yang baru dan yang luar biasa dan juga bercakap mengenai pencinta makanan seluruh dunia lebih seperti gastronomi makanan.\r\n\r\n	Kulinari “enthusiasm”\r\n\r\n	Lebih daripada kepelbagaian makanan yang ada, rancangan televisyen seperti Top Chef, No Reservations, Food Challenge, Good Eats, Iron Chef America, dan banyak rancangan memasak lain yang besar menggalakkan pilihan-pilihan makanan kepada pasaran yang lebih luas berbanding sebelum ini. Malah, terdapat saluran TV keseluruhan khusus untuk penyediaan makanan, pertandingan masakan, dan resipi baru. \r\n\r\n	Media cetak dan elektronik telah memberi impak di mana institusi-instusi pendidikan di dalam masakan mempunyai banyak kelebihan berbanding bekerja di dapur. Dan bukan hanya untuk bakal chef restoran, pelajar mendapat peluang untuk bertemu chef dan profesional perkhidmatan makanan. Banyak juga program masakan juga melibatkan beberapa jenis program externship yang menyediakan satu lagi peluang untuk berinteraksi dengan tukang masak profesional dan majikan yang berpotensi. \r\n \r\nProspek Kerjaya\r\n	\r\n	Terdapat semua jenis pekerjaan yang ditawarkan di bawah program kulinari: bukan hanya bekerja di dapur-dapur restoran, malah di dalam bidang penyelidikan dan pembangunan bagi sebuah syarikat seperti McDonald dan lain-lain lagi. \r\n\r\n	Impak kepada Alam Sekitar\r\n\r\n	Memberi impak yang bagus di dalam sistem pembuangan sisa makanan, pengendalian makanan dan Keselamatan makanan.\r\n\r\n	Perlu Intervensi Nutrisi Pemakanan \r\n\r\n	Kajian menunjukkan bahawa pengambilan sayur-sayuran dan buah-buahan yang tidak mencukupi dan kekurangan kemahiran penyediaan makanan, dan peningkatan saiz bahagian makanan menyumbang kepada peningkatan dalam obesiti dan penyakit kronik (Rafioura, Sargent, Anderson, & Evans, 2002; Lino, Gerrior, Basiotis, & Anand, 1998). Maka wujudnya minat yang semakin mendalam dalam masakan dan pemakanan kerana peningkatan jumlah chef selebriti, majalah masakan, serta yang berkaitan rancangan dan segmen.  Televisyen. Disebabkan oleh peningkatan pergantungan kepada kemudahan, rakyat Amerika contohnya, telah merubah amalan pemakanan yang drastik dan berbeza berbanding generasi sebelumnya. Malah, peratusan bajet makanan yang dibelanjakan untuk membeli makanan diluar telah secara beransur-ansur meningkat sejak pertengahan 1970-an, dan hari ini rakyat Amerika membelanjakan kira-kira 49% daripada bajet makanan mereka dan mengambil 32% daripada kalori mereka jauh-dari makanan -Home (USDA, 2007).  \r\n\r\n	Kurang memasak di rumah dan banyak makan di luar bermakna pemakanan kemungkinan besar mengandungi kurang buah-buahan, sayur-sayuran, dan susu manakala membekalkan lemak lebih tepu dan kalori yang lebih banyak (Keystone, 2006). Pengambilan makanan oleh Individu yang mempunyai pengetahuan yang lebih luas makan makanan campuran yang lebih sihat berbanding daripada orang-orang yang kurang pendidikan pemakanan (Guthrie, Lin, Reed, & Steward, 2005).Beberapa kajian menunjukkan kemahiran memasak semakin berkurangan, sekali gus keupayaan orang ramai untuk menyediakan makanan berkhasiat semakin berkurangan (Short, 2003).  \r\n \r\nPengetahuan di dalam bidang masakan sahaja telah terbukti bukan sahaja berkesan dalam mengubah tingkah laku pemakanan seseorang, tetapi persembahan amali memasak dan merasa demonstrasi masakan kelihatan jauh lebih memberangsangkan (Horodynski, Hoerr, & Coleman, 2004). Ilmu pengetahuan serta pendidikan mengenai dunia masakan berupaya membantu peserta dalam mengawal bahan masakan yang dipilih, gaya penyediaan makanan yang sesuai serta saiz bahan makanan yang disediakan (Lang & Caraher, 2001).\r\n	\r\n	Menggabungkan kualiti makanan seperti rasa, dan penampilan bersama-sama dengan matlamat pemakanan yang sihat DeAngelis, Blenkiron, & Vieira, 2001 di dalam menggunakan prinsip-prinsip  pemakanan untuk penyediaan makanan mengubah pembelajaran, pengalaman membenarkan orang ramai untuk benar-benar melihat, merasa, dan rasa apa tentang pemakanan.\r\n\r\n', '	Dari aspek ekonomi, sektor perkhidmatan merupakan trend yang menyumbang kepada peningkatan pekerja mahir (Buera & Kaboski, 2009). Objektif utama industri hospitaliti adalah untuk menyediakan tahap perkhidmatan yang cemerlang dan menurut jumlah Keluaran Dalam Negara Kasar (KDNK) sektor pelancongan telah menjana 881,000 pekerjaan bagi tahun 2013. Menurut World Council Travel and Tourism (2014), memandangkan Pelan Transformasi Pelancongan Malaysia ingin mencapai 36 juta pelancong pada tahun 2020 daripada 24.6 juta pelancong pada tahun 2010, ini bermakna sektor pelancongan akan meningkat.\r\n	 \r\n \r\nLaporan Pusat Maklumat Kerjaya oleh Kementerian Sumber Manusia Malaysia menunjukkan purata gaji bulanan dalam bidang kulinari ialah RM1,400 sehingga RM2,300 dalam sektor swasta dan RM1,515 sehingga RM1,814 dalam sektor awam.

Antara cabaran utama yang dihadapi oleh majikan ialah bakal pekerja atau graduan yang tidak berupaya dalam komunikasi, kelemahan dalam bahasa terutamanya Bahasa Inggeris dan juga pemikiran kritikal. \r\n\r\nAntara isu utama yang turut ditimbulkan oleh Gabungan Majikan Malaysia (Malaysian Employers Federation) pada tahun 2010 ialah kesukaran majikan untuk mencari bakal pekerja yang berkebolehan berkomunikasi, berfikir, kemampuan merancang, pengurusan serta kebolehan dalam ICT serta mahir bertutur dalam Bahasa Inggeris.\r\n\r\nKekurangan personel yang mempunyai kemahiran komunikasi strategik di Malaysia berdasarkan senario tersebut sangat membimbangkan. Ini menunjukkan bahawa Malaysia memerlukan tenaga profesional yang dapat memenuhi aspirasi Negara bagi mencapai tahap untuk membina hubungan baik antara institusi perniagaan dengan pemegang taruhnya menerusi pelbagai saluran seperti laporan tahunan, aktiviti kemasyarakatan, aktiviti tanggungjawab sosial korporat serta polisi dan prestasi syarikat.\r\n\r\nBerdasarkan kepakaran yang diperlukan dan juga keperluan oleh setiap organisasi dan institusi perniagaan yang berdaftar dengan Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia dan juga SME Corporation, lebih 600 ribu syarikat memerlukan tenaga kerja profesional seperti lima teras keperluan yang telah digariskan oleh Corporate Governance Blueprint 2011.\r\nInternational Public Relations Association (IPRA) sebagai badan yang mengawal selia bidang berkaitan industry komunikasi pula menyatakan bahawa “[Successful] government and nonprofit capacity building requires strategic communication”. Kenyataan ini menunjukkan bahawa pihak yang terlibat seperti kerajaan dan pertubuhan bukan kerajaan (yang tidak berasakan keuntungan) memerlukan khidmat profesional pakar sebagai medium untuk berkomunikasi dengan strategik dan berkesan bagi memastikan pelaksanaan dasar awam dapat dijelaskan kepada umum.\r\nDengan mengambil kira maklumat daripada SME Corporation, lebih 600 ribu syarikat Kecil dan Sederhana berdaftar dengan SME Corp sehingga tahun 2015. Manakala sebanyak lebih daripada 5 juta syarikat termasuk 5,000 syarikat asing yang telah berdaftar di bawah Suruhanjaya Syarikat Malaysia. Dengan mengambil kira sebanyak 20 peratus syarikat yang aktif daripada yang berdaftar dengan operasi yang besar dan mempunyai pekerja melebihi 100 orang, sebanyak 1.12 juta syarikat yang tertakluk dibawah Akta Syarikat (1965) memerlukan individu yang bertanggungjawab untuk menghasilkan laporan tahunan lebih dinamik terutamanya dalam pelaporan Tanggungjawab Sosial merangkumi kepada semua pemegang taruh. Di bawah Suruhanjaya Sekuriti Malaysia, semua organisasi yang berdaftar sebanyak 1,500 buah dengan Suruhanjaya tersebut mewajibkan semua organisasi perniagaan memberikan laporan secara berkala mengenai aktiviti perniagaan dan juga tahunan kepada pemegang taruh.Tanggungjawab ini memerlukan pekerja (diperingkat pengurusan atau sekurang-kurangnya eksekutif) untuk mempunyai kemahiran berkomunikasi secara strategik dengan lebih baik terutamanya untuk menghasilkan maklumat yang lebih dinamik dan telus. Sehubungan itu, kemahiran untuk berkomunikasi secara strategik sangat diperlukan dalam pelbagai industri di Malaysia malahan di peringkat global (Mokhtarrudin Ahmad, 2011).\r\n\r\nTalent Corp. Malaysia (2016) menyatakan keperluan kepada 43 ribu peluang pekerjaan di dalam bidang Komunikasi dan hampir 245 ribu peluang dalam bidang perniagaan menjelang 2020 (https://www.talentcorp.com.my/facts-and-figures/job-opportunities-by-nkea) \r\n \r\nBerdasarkan statistic dari JobStreet.com, 39% graduan yang mempunyai kebolehan kepimpinan berpotensi untuk mendapat kerja lebih mudah berbanding graduan lain dan seterusnya mengurangkan lagi nisbah graduan yang lemah berkomunikasi serta kurang kemahiran kendiri yang menjadi faktor mengapa graduan kurang mendapat peluang pekerjaan.\r\n\r\n Tambahan pula, statistik dari Talent Corp menyatakan bahawa graduan dari bidang ini juga berpotensi dalam kategori pekerjaan sebagai Management and Organisation Analysts atau Advertising and Marketing Professionals yang telah  dikategorikan sebagai bidang pekerjaan yang tersenarai dalam The Critical Occupational List (COL) 2015/2016. \r\n', 'Antara bidang-bidang perkhidmatan yang memerlukan graduan-graduan program akademik ini ialah:\r\n\r\n•	Bidang Pentadbiran - Pegawai Tadbir Kanan\r\n•	Bidang Pemasaran - Pegawai Pemasaran\r\n•	Bidang Pendidikan – Pensyarah, Tutor (Awam & Swasta)\r\n•	Bidang Media dan Komunikasi - Pengurus Acara, Perunding, Penulis, Editor\r\n•	Bidang Keusahawanan - Usahawan\r\n', 'Laporan daripada Talent Corporation Dengan Kerjasama Bank Dunia mengenai kebolehpasaran graduan pada tahun 2014 pula mendapati;\r\n\r\ni.	81% organisasi beranggapan bahawa kebolehan berkomunikasi merupakan kemahiran utama yang tidak ada dalam kalangan graduan.\r\nii.	80% organisasi beranggapan bahawa kurikulum universiti seharusnya disemak semula untuk mengambarkan keperluan pasaran terkini.\r\n\r\nLaporan tersebut menunjukkan bahawa peluang kebolehpasaran bagi graduan dari bidang komunikasi strategik adalah pada kitaran 80%. \r\n\r\nLaporan dari World Economic Forum (2016) juga menyatakan keperluan kepada Talent diversity di mana graduan atau bakal pekerja yang mempunyai kemahiran pelbagai lebih berpeluang mendapat pekerjaan berbanding mereka yang mahir dalam satu bidang sahaja (www.weforum.org) \r\n\r\nAdalah penting untuk melahirkan graduan yang boleh memenuhi kehendak majikan serta negara yang mementingkan graduan yang berkualiti, boleh berkomunikasi dengan baik terutamanya dalam Bahasa Inggeris, mempunyai ‘mind-set’ perniagaan, berfikiran analitikal dan juga pengalaman kerja (dalam program ini, pengalaman kerja diterjemahkan menerusi kursus Internship selama satu (1) tahun)\r\n', 'Perkembangan dan perubahan teknologi juga telah merubah gaya komunikasi antara sesebuah organisasi dengan pemegang taruh seperti pemegang saham, masyarakat setempat, badan kerajaan, pengguna dan juga pelabur massa.

Keusahawanan sosial merupakan satu agenda baru pembangunan dunia di abad ke-21. Di barat,  disiplin ilmu berkaitannya masih giat diterokai sama ada dari aspek teori mahupun praktikal. Dalam konteks Malaysia pula, penawaran program keusahawanan sosial Islam merupakan salah satu usaha untuk merintis serta menyumbang kepada pembinaan dan pemantapan bidang ilmu ini. Malah sehingga hari ini, bidang ini dalam konteks program pengajian di peringkat ijazah sarjana muda belum lagi diterokai oleh mana-mana institusi pengajian tinggi di Malaysia. Sebagai satu bidang ilmu yang secara relatifnya dianggap baru dan sedang giat berkembang, malah dengan permintaan yang tinggi terhadap produk hasil keluaran  program ini di peringkat global, program ini diyakini mampu bertahan dan terus relevan untuk jangka masa yang panjang sekurang-kurangnya dalam tempoh 30 tahun.

Data menunjukkan bahawa dalam tempoh 6 tahun terakhir sahaja bermula tahun 2010 hingga 2015, sejumlah 64% daripada jumlah keseluruhan entiti keusahawanan sosial di Malaysia telah ditubuhkan dalam tempoh tersebut. Lebih signifikan lagi, 26% iaitu suku daripada jumlah keseluruhan entiti telah ditubuhkan dalam tempoh setahun terakhir iaitu dari tahun 2014 hingga 2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n(sumber: State of Social Enterprise in Malaysia 2014/2015, ms 9.)\r\n\r\n Data ini secara tidak langsung menggambarkan peningkatan pertumbuhan sektor keusahawanan sosial di negara ini pada tahun-tahun yang akan datang. \r\nSebagai sokongan kepada kenyataan di atas, kajian yang telah dijalankan oleh MaGIC ini yang melibatkan kaedah temubual secara mendalam ke atas 144 organisasi keusahawanan sosial antara November 2014 hingga 2015 mendapati sebanyak 96% responden melihat bahawa usaha niaga mereka mempunyai prospek pertumbuhan yang positif dan masa depan yang baik.\r\nSelaras dengan kepesatan pertumbuhan dan prospek yang cerah ini, sektor keusahawanan sosial bakal bahkan sedang menyaksikan peningkatan keperluan sumber manusia dan kepakaran yang berkaitan. Kajian yang sama menunjukkan majoriti organisasi keusahawanan sosial menyatakan keperluan mereka kepada sumber manusia dan kepakaran yang berkaitan. Data menunjukkan bahawa 68% organisasi yang ditemubual bercadang untuk merekrut tenaga kerja baru dalam masa terdekat. Namun, pada masa yang sama 68% organisasi menyatakan bahawa sukar bagi mereka untuk mendapatkan tenaga kerja baru, di mana 74% daripada mereka menyatakan bahawa cabaran utama yang dihadapi ialah kesukaran mendapatkan individu dengan bakat dan kepakaran yang sesuai. Sebahagian organisasi juga menyatakan bahawa keadaan ini lebih sukar lagi apabila organisasi tersebut tidak mampu untuk menyediakan latihan formal berkenaan keusahawanan sosial bagi staf mereka. \r\n \r\nSumber: State of Social Enterprise in Malaysia 2014/2015\r\n\r\nTambahan lagi, data kajian menunjukkan hanya 3% sahaja usahawan sosial lahir dari kalangan pelajar dan graduan baru, manakala selebihnya iaitu 61% lahir dari kalangan korporat, dan 36% datang dari sektor sosial seperti alam sekitar, pendidikan, vokasional dan lain-lain. Ini menunjukkan bahawa kepakaran dalam bidang keusahawanan sosial amatlah perlu diwujudkan pada peringkat Ijazah Sarjana Muda lagi. \r\n \r\n\r\nSumber: State of Social Enterprise in Malaysia 2014/2015, ms 28.)\r\n\r\n', 'Usahawan dan perniagaan sosial, Pegawai Pemasaran, Eksekutif Pembangunan Perniagaan/ Zakat dan Wakaf,  Eksekutif Jualan , Eksekutif  Pelaburan/ Penjanaan Dana keusahawanan Sosial , Eksekutif Perancangan Korporat dan Strategik, Pengurus/Eksekutif Pentadbiran, Eksekutif Latihan, Eksekutif  Sumber Manusia, Pegawai Perhubungan dan Khidmat Pelanggan, Eksekutif Inovasi Sosial,\r\nPengurus dan Eksekutif Projek dan Program, Pegawai Kebajikan Masyarakat, Eksekutif Pembangunan Masyarakat, Eksekutif Tanggungjawab Sosial (CSR), Eksekutif Operasi dan Bantuan \r\nPensyarah (Awam & Swasta), Pegawai Penyelidik dan Pembangunan  Sosial, Pegawai Zakat dan Wakaf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Berdasarkan data yang telah dijelaskan di atas, majoriti organisasi  keusahawanan sosial mendapati sukar untuk memperkembangkan organisasi mereka berikutan kesukaran untuk mendapatkan kepakaran dan sumber manusia dalam bidang ini.

Berdasarkan hal ini, graduan yang telah dilatih dengan idea dan kemahiran dalam bidang keusahawanan boleh dilihat sebagai jawapan kepada masalah yang berlaku. Oleh yang demikian, secara relatifnya pasaran bagi bakal-bakal graduan bercirikan keusahawanan sosial adalah terbuka luas. Graduan dengan ciri ini bukan hanya kompeten sebagai tenaga kerja, malah juga mampu menjadi usahawan sosial yang mandiri yang seterusnya mampu mewujudkan peluang-peluang pekerjaan baru untuk orang lain.\r\n\r\nBerikut adalah prospek kerjaya yang diperlukan dalam sektor keusahawan sosial berdasarkan Social Enterprise National Survey of 2015.\r\n\r\n \r\nSumber: State of Social Enterprise in Malaysia 2014/2015, ms 39.\r\n\r\nTambahan lagi, keunikan program Ijazah Sarjana Muda Keusahawanan Sosial Islam bukan hanya bakal melahirkan bakal-bakal graduan yang boleh diterima bekerja di organisasi-organisasi berorientasikan  konvensional, malah dengan nilai tambah berupa ilmu keusahawanan bercirikan Islam, graduan ini juga kompeten untuk diambil bekerja di organisasi-organisasi bercirikan Islam. \r\n\r\n\r\n', 'Perkembangan teknologi terkini khususnya dalam teknologi maklumat menjadikan bidang keusahawanan sosial berkembang dengan cepat.

Unsur-unsur gabungan antara teknologi, kreativiti dan keperluan masyarakat seperti e-perniagaan, pemasaran internet, jaringan global dan rekabentuk perkhidmatan diterapkan dalam program ini agar para graduan yang dihasilkan dapat bekerja  dalam persekitaran berteknologi seperti yang dinyatakan di atas. \r\n\r\n', 'Merealisasikan misi nasional \r\nAgenda keusahawanan sosial merupakan agenda yang dipandang serius di peringkat kebangsaan, malah di peringkat global. Keseriusan ini dibuktikan dengan penubuhan MaGIC Social Entrepreneurship pada tahun 2013, sebuah unit keusahawanan sosial di bawah Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre (MaGIC), sebagai pemangkin kepada usaha-usaha keusahawanan sosial. Melalui unit ini, kerajaan telah melancarkan Malaysian Social Enterprise Blueprint 2015-2018 bagi melakar strategi ke arah pembangunan dan pemerkasaan kegiatan keusahawanan sosial di Malaysia. Penawaran program Ijazah Sarjana Muda Keusahawanan Sosial Islam ini merupakan satu usaha yang tepat untuk menyahut aspirasi kerajaan ke arah memantapkan sektor keusahawanan sosial di negara ini.\r\n Selain itu, program ini juga bakal menyumbang kepada pencapaian negara dalam menjadi sebuah negara maju pada tahun 2020 dalam acuannya yang tersendiri menerusi realisasi misi nasional dalam konteks pendidikan tinggi. Sebagai sebuah negara yang kaya dengan sumber alam dan sumber manusia dari pelbagai etnik dan bangsa, konsep keusahawanan sosial menjadi wadah yang strategik untuk membangunkan masyarakat yang mandiri dan mampu mencipta peluang dari kepelbagaian latar yang wujud di Malaysia. Tambahan pula, program ini menyokong pembangunan modal insan negara yang penting dalam kejayaan dan matlamat Rancangan Malaysia Ke-10 serta menjadi pemangkin ke arah mencapai lonjakan pertama ‘Holistic, Entrepreneurial and Balanced Graduates’ sebagaimana yang disasarkan dalam Pelan Pembangunan Pendidikan Malaysia 2015-2025 (Pendidikan Tinggi) oleh Kementerian Pendidikan Malaysia.\r\n\r\nMembekalkan tenaga profesional berlatar belakangkan pengajian Islam dengan minda keusahawanan \r\nModal insan berpengetahuan Islam dan pada masa berminda keusahawanan sememangnya amat diperlukan khususnya bagi memperkasakan institusi-institusi sosio-ekonomi Islam pada masa kini. Institusi wakaf sebagai contoh, walaupun mempunyai potensi yang besar sebagai wadah pembangunan ekonomi ummah, namun data daripada JAWHAR menunjukkan bahawa sehingga November 2011, hanya 0.21% sahaja daripada jumlah keluasan tanah wakaf di Malaysia iaitu 11,091.82 hektar yang telah dimajukan di bawah Program Pembangunan Hartanah wakaf JAWHAR. Antara kekangan utama yang membantutkan pembangunan ini, berdasarkan kertas kerja oleh Datuk Anan Mohd, Ketua Pengarah JAWHAR ialah kekurangan tenaga profesional berkemahiran dalam aspek perancangan dan pembangunan tanah wakaf. Penawaran program ini dilihat mampu memenuhi keperluan modal insan berpengetahuan agama dan pada masa yang sama berminda usahawan yang mampu membawa idea-idea baru yang mampu membawa pembaharuan kepada sektor sosio ekonomi Islam di negara ini. \r\nSehubungan itu, perkembangan terkini di institusi swasta khususnya di sektor perbankan telah menampakkan inisiatif mengenai pelaksanaan konsep wakaf dalam pelbagai bentuk yang berinovatif seperti wakaf tunai, wakaf saham dan seumpamanya. Contohnya Bank Muamalat, bank Islam, Maybank, wakaf Annur Corporation. Selain itu, kekurangan tenaga mahir berkaitan pelaksanaan wakaf dan CSR di institusi tersebut bakal membuka peluang bagi graduan KSI untuk memenuhi keperluan tersebut.

Pada masa yang sama, universiti akan dapat menghasilkan lebih ramai graduan dengan pengetahuan dan kemahiran yang berkaitan dan sekaligus membina masyarakat yang bercirikan keusahawanan. \r\n\r\n\r\nPasaran dan keperluan semasa \r\nProgram ini telah dibangunkan berbeza daripada program keusahawanan dan perniagaan di IPTA dan IPTS lain kerana mempunyai niche yang tersendiri. Program ini memberi penumpuan kepada aspek keusahawanan sosial bercirikan Islam. Mendepani minat dan kecenderungan masyarakat untuk memilih kaedah-kaedah yang ditawarkan oleh Islam, program ini akan mengangkat banyak projek berteraskan keusahawanan sosial Islam seperti wakaf korporat dan seumpamanya untuk diarus perdanakan dalam konteks akademik dan penyelidikan. Produk-produk baharu ini sangat diperlukan dalam pasaran semasa. Oleh itu, graduan program ini yang diterapkan dengan nilai-nilai keusahawanan yang tinggi berperanan besar untuk membangunkan  produk-produk keusahawanan sosial yang baharu  dan memenuhi keperluan industri dan pengguna. Oleh itu, permintaan bagi modal insan dalam bidang ini akan sentiasa meningkat pada peringkat tempatan dan global.\r\n\r\nMemperluaskan Bidang Pendidikan Tinggi dalam Negara\r\nJustifikasi utama penawaran program ini ialah keunikannya sebagai satu program yang baharu yang belum ditawarkan di mana-mana IPT di Malaysia. Selain itu, pendekatan pengajaran dan pembelajaran mengaplikasikan konsep 3+1 (3 tahun di universiti dan 1 tahun di industri) menyokong Pelan Pembangunan Pendidikan Malaysia (Pendidikan Tinggi) 2015 – 2025, Lonjakan 1 iaitu melahirkan graduan holistik, berciri keusahawanan dan seimbang.\r\n\r\nGraduan dalam program ini akan didedahkan dalam berbagai aspek keusahawanan dari konteks pembangunan sosial yang berteraskan prinsip Islam. Graduan ini juga berkeupayaan untuk melaksanakan penyelidikan dan pengkomersilan hasil penyelidikan untuk pembangunan sektor keusahawanan berteraskan modal sosial dan seterusnya memberi perkhidmatan dan mewujudkan rangkaian kerjasama bagi memenuhi tanggungjawab sosial.\r\n \r\nDengan ciri-ciri tersebut, para graduan dari program ini diyakini akan berupaya memenuhi keperluan masyarakat dan kehendak pasaran malahan mampu memberi sumbangan yang bermakna kepada kemajuan masyarakat serta pembangunan Negara. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI', '', '', '', '', '', '[[\"Tiada Pertindihan dengan Universiti Awam di Malaysia\",\"\"],[\"\",\"\"]]', '[[\"Tiada Pertindihan dengan Universiti Swasta di Malaysia\",\"\"]]', 'Tiada berkaitan', '', '', '', '', 0),

Rentetan itu, pihak UMK melalui FKP berada di landasan yang betul untuk mewujudkan program baharu iaitu Sarjana Muda Keusahawanan (Teknologi Maklumat dan Komunikasi) ini, dengan mengambil kira  permintaan yang tinggi dari pihak industri. \r\n', 'Perkembangan dan perubahan teknologi\r\n\r\nPerkembangan teknologi terkini khususnya teknologi maklumat pada masa ini, menjadikan ia signifikan kepada semua bidang. Urusniaga dan aktiviti pelaburan dan kewangan tidak dapat berjalan dengan lancar dan berkesan tanpa penggunaan teknologi. Bagi menyesuaikan persekitaran yang sedemikian, maka program ini direkabentuk agar ia dilaksanakan dalam persekitaran yang fleksibel dan boleh disesuaikan dengan perkembangan teknologi semasa.  Unsur-unsur gabungan antara teknologi dan perniagaaan serta rekabentuk perkhidmatan akan diterapkan dalam program ini agar para graduan yang dikeluarkan dapat menyesuaikan diri  dalam persekitaran yang berteknologi seperti yang dinyatakan di atas.\r\n		\r\nPelan Strategik Pendidikan Tinggi Negara (2007-2010) bertujuan meningkatkan daya saing negara agar terus kekal kompetitif dalam suasana pasaran yang senantiasa berubah. Dalam cabaran untuk Pelan Strategik Pendidikan Negara (2007-2010) juga menyatakan sistem pengajian tinggi semasa memerlukan kepelbagaian program pengajian dan latihan untuk memastikan semua orang berpeluang menyertai pengajian tinggi tanpa kekangan kewangan. Sementara itu ekuiti pula memerlukan kesaksamaan dari segi penyertaan pengajian tertiari mengikut pecahan status ekonomi, etnik, wilayah dan keupayaan fizikal. Oleh itu,perlu dipastikan meritokrasi kepelbagaian dan laluan khas yang diperlukan oleh golongan tertentu bukan sahaja mendapat perhatian sewajarnya tetapi terus dipertingkatkan oleh kerajaan. \r\n\r\n\r\nProgram yang akan dilaksanakan memberi peluang pendidikan tinggi kepada Lepasan STPM/Matrikulasi dan Lepasan Diploma/Setaraf dalam bidang analisis pelaburan yang digabungkan dengan penggunaan teknologi terkini.\r\n', 'Lain-lain justifikasi yang berkaitan.\r\n\r\n1.	Merealisasikan Misi Nasional\r\n\r\nCabaran keenam daripada sembilan strategi dalam mencapai wawasan 2020 yang semakin hampir adalah merujuk kepada keperluan Malaysia untuk mewujudkan “...masyarakat yang saintifik dan progresif, masyarakat yang inovatif yang bukan sahaja menjadi pengguna kepada teknologi malah menjadi penyumbang kepada dunia sains dan teknologi pada masa depan...” (Mahathir Mohamad, 1998). Oleh itu, kewujudan program yang bakal ditawarkan dilihat dapat membantu negara merealisasikan wawasan 2020. Hal ini kerana graduan bakal dilengkapi dengan ilmu berkaitan dengan teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi di akhir pengajian. Dengan itu, mereka mampu untuk menyumbang serta mendukung hasrat kerajaan untuk menjadi negara membangun melalui penguasaan, penggunaan, dan inovasi di dalam bidang teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi khususnya untuk manfaat bidang keusahawanan dan perniagaan. \r\n\r\n\r\n2.	Mendokong Falsafah Universiti \r\n\r\nFalsafah Universiti Malaysia Kelantan memberi penekanan kepada enam aspek utama iaitu: 1) pendidikan keusahawanan 2) bahasa ketiga 3) teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi sebagai pengupaya 4) pembelajaran sepanjang hayat 5) modal insan yang berkualiti serta 6) keunikan dan relevan. Ini menunjukkan bahawa pihak universiti memahami keperluan dan kepentingan teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi secara amnya. Namun, pihak universiti perlu mempunyai perancangan yang lebih rapi untuk memperkukuhkan lagi kedudukan teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi di universiti. Ini termasuklah mempertimbangkan cadangan supaya Program Sarjana Muda Keusahawanan (Teknologi Maklumat dan Komunikasi) dengan Kepujian dapat dilaksanakan. \r\n\r\n\r\n3.	Memenuhi Perkembangan Teknologi Maklumat dan Komunikasi di dalam Bidang Keusahawanan dan Perniagaan\r\n\r\nKepentingan teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi dalam bidang keusahawanan dan perniagaan sudah tidak mampu disangkal. Hal ini kerana penggunaan teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi yang tidak berkesan akan menyebabkan urusniaga tidak dapat berjalan dengan produktif. Oleh itu, bagi menyesuaikan diri terhadap persekitaran yang sedemikian, program ini direkabentuk untuk memberi pengkhususan kepada teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi yang dikenalpasti mampu untuk mewujudkan, mengekalkan, dan memperbaiki sesebuah perusahaan atau perniagaan.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.	Menawarkan Program yang Mampu Memenuhi Permintaan Pasaran \r\n\r\nSesungguhnya, program yang bakal dicadangkan penawarannya pada semester 2017/2018 ini mempunyai kelainan daripada program yang ditawarkan oleh Universiti Awam (UA) dan Universiti Swasta (US) lain di negara ini kerana mempunyai tujahan  yang tersendiri. Kaedah pembelajaran yang menggunakan pendekatan yang lebih holistik iaitu penggunaan kaedah pembelajaran yang berasaskan hasil (outcome based learning) dan permasalahan serta pendekatan pembelajaran yang berasaskan “dalam industri” dijangka akan  dapat memberi pengalaman sebenar kepada pelajar terhadap aplikasi teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi di dalam sektor keusahawanan dan perniagaan. Kaedah ini amat bersesuaian dengan persekitaran ekonomi yang berasaskan pengetahuan yang perlu dipandu berdasarkan ilmu teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi. Maka sewajarnya Universiti Malaysia Kelantan menawarkan program Sarjana Muda Keusahawanan (Teknologi Maklumat dan Komunikasi) untuk menarik permintaan pelajar di peringkat tempatan dan juga global yang mahukan pengisian yang lebih menarik di dalam pembelajaran.\r\n\r\nDi samping itu, program ini juga mampu memenuhi dasar pembangunan KPT yang inginkan lebih banyak program yang menjurus kepada peningkatan kemahiran keusahawanan dalam kalangan pelajar universiti. Hasrat utama program ini ialah untuk melahirkan usahawan yang berasaskan kepada ilmu teknologi maklumat & komunikasi (ICT based entrepreneurs).\r\n\r\n\r\n5.	Memenuhi Keperluan Tenaga Manusia Negara\r\n\r\nPenyelidikan Ekonomi Malaysia (MIER) menyatakan bahawa negara akan menghadapi masalah tenaga kerja menjelang tahun 2020, khususnya dalam bidang kejuruteraan, sains, dan teknologi sekiranya langkah-langkah drastik dalam menangani masalah keperluan sumber manusia tidak diambil tindakan segera. Ini turut disokong oleh kajian yang dijalankan oleh World Bank/United Nations Development Programs mengenai “Technology Development For Innovation: Towards Malaysia’s Vision 2020” yang menyatakan senario yang sama menjelang tahun 2020. Di bawah Dasar Pembangunan Negara (DPN) serta Pelan Induk Perindustrian (IMP), pembangunan sumber manusia amat penting bagi pembangunan dan  perindustrian negara. Semua Universiti Awam (UA) dan Universiti Swasta (US) termasuk Universiti Malaysia Kelantan mempunyai peranan penting menerusi pendidikan peringkat tertiari untuk mempertingkatkan usaha menambah bilangan mahir teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi. \r\n\r\n\r\n6.	Memperluaskan Peluang Pendidikan Tinggi dalam Bidang Teknologi Maklumat dan Komunikasi\r\n\r\nPelan Strategik Pendidikan Tinggi Negara Fasa 2 (2007-2010) adalah bertujuan untuk meningkatkan daya saing negara. Namun, untuk mengekalkan momentum di dalam suasana pasaran yang sentiasa berubah memerlukan peluang pendidikan tinggi yang lebih besar. Dengan itu, Universiti Malaysia Kelantan dilihat mampu untuk menjana sifat berdaing saing dengan memperkenalkan program yang memberi peluang pendidikan tinggi kepada lepasan STPM/Matrikulasi dan Lepasan Diploma/Setaraf dalam bidang teknologi maklumat dan komunikasi yang berteraskan keusahawanan dan perniagaan. \r\n', '', '', '', '', '', '', '', 'Tiada', '', '', '', '', 0),
